## About igraph

* Network analysis library, written mostly in C/C++.
* Interface to R and Python
* https://github.com/igraph
* http://igraph.org
* Mailing list, stack overflow help.
* Open GitHub issues for bugs

## What is new?

* New ways to manipulate networks
* `[` and `[[` operators
* Better function names, manipulators
* Pipe friendly
* New methods:
    * Graph layout algorithms
    * New methods for graph clustering
    * Graphlet decomposition
    * Embeddings
    * Graph matching
    * etc.

## The `[` operator

Imaginary adjacency matrix, queries




```r
air['BOS', 'SFO']
```

```
#> [1] 6
```

```r
CA <- c("LAX", "SFO", "SAN", "SMF", "SNA", "BUR", "OAK", "ONT", "SJC")
air['BOS', CA]
```

```
#> LAX SFO SAN SMF SNA BUR OAK ONT SJC 
#>   7   6   1   0   0   0   0   0   1
```

## The `[` operator

Imaginary adjacency matrix, manipulation

Add an edge (and potentially set its weight):

```r
air["BOS", "ANC"] <- TRUE
air["BOS", "ANC"]
```

```
#> [1] 1
```

Remove an edge:

```r
air["BOS", "ANC"] <- FALSE
air["BOS", "ANC"]
```

```
#> [1] 0
```

## The `[[` operator

Imaginary adjacency list, adjacenct vertices:


```r
air[["BOS"]]
```

```
#> $BOS
#> + 269/755 vertices, named:
#>   [1] BGR JFK JFK JFK JFK JFK JFK JFK JFK JFK JFK JFK JFK JFK JFK
#>  [16] LAS LAS LAS MIA MIA EWR EWR EWR EWR EWR EWR EWR EWR EWR EWR
#>  [31] LAX LAX LAX LAX LAX LAX LAX PBI PBI PIT PIT PIT PIT PIT SFO

#> [136] MKE MKE MKE MSP MSP MSP MSP MSP MSP MSY MYR ORF PHF PHL PHL
#> + ... omitted several vertices
```

## The `[[` operator

Imaginary adjacency list, adjacent vertices:


```r
air[[, "BOS"]]
```

```
#> $BOS
#> + 256/755 vertices, named:
#>   [1] BGR JFK JFK JFK JFK JFK JFK JFK JFK JFK JFK JFK JFK LAS LAS
#>  [16] LAS MIA MIA MIA EWR EWR EWR EWR EWR EWR EWR EWR LAX LAX LAX
#>  [31] LAX LAX LAX LAX LAX PBI PBI PIT PIT PIT PIT SFO SFO SFO SFO
#>  [46] SFO SFO IAD IAD IAD IAD IAD IAD IAD IAD IAD BDL BDL BDL BUF
#>  [61] BUF BUF BUF BWI BWI BWI BWI BWI BWI CAK CAK CLE CLE CLE CLE
#>  [76] CLE CLE CLT CLT CLT CLT CLT CLT CLT CLT CMH CMH CVG CVG CVG

#> + ... omitted several vertices
```

## Consistent function names

`make_*`, `sample_*`, `cluster_*`, `layout_*`, `graph_from_*`,
`as_*`, etc.

## Manipulators for `make_` and `sample_`


```r
ring <- make_(ring(10), with_vertex_(color = "grey", size = 25))
par(mar=c(0,0,0,0)); plot(ring)
```

![](user2015_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png) 

## Manipulators for `make_` and `sample_`


```r
rg <- sample_(degseq(c(2,4,6,8,2,2,2,2)),
              simplified())
```

## Manipulators for `layout_`


```r
g <- make_ring(5) + make_full_graph(5) + make_star(5, mode="undir")
coords <- layout_(g, in_circle(), component_wise())
par(mar=c(0,0,0,0)); plot(g)
```

![](user2015_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png) 

## Pipe friendly syntax


```r
g <- make_empty_graph(10) %>%
  add_vertices(5) %>%
  set_vertex_attr("name", value = LETTERS[1:5]) %>%
  add_edges(c(1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,1)) %>%
  set_edge_attr("weight", value = runif(gsize(.)))
```

## Easier connection to other packages


```r
library(networkD3)
d3_net <- simpleNetwork(as_data_frame(karate, what = "edges")[, 1:3])
d3_net
```

## Current work

* Better connection to other packages and external software 
* Inference
* Infrastructure cleanup
